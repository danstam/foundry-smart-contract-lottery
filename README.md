# Unfinished Smart Contract 

This is an unfinished Solidity project that I'm currently working on as part of my learning process. I've encountered a "Stack too deep" error when running `forge coverage`, and I'm seeking help to resolve this issue.

## Project Details

- Solidity Version: 0.8.18
- Error: "Stack too deep" when running `forge coverage`

## Issue Description

When I run `forge coverage` on my project, I encounter a "Stack too deep" error. This error typically occurs when a function uses more than 16 local variables, which is a limitation of the EVM. However, the error message doesn't specify where the issue is coming from, making it challenging to pinpoint the problematic function. I've tried searching through my codebase for complex functions or ones with many local variables, but I haven't had any luck so far. I also attempted to optimize the code by adding `viaIR: true` to my `foundry.toml` file, but this didn't resolve the issue. Additionally, I experimented with using AI to solve the problem, but it did not yield a solution.

Interestingly, when I run `forge test`, everything works fine, and no errors are thrown. The problem only arises when I run `forge coverage`.

## Seeking Assistance

I've created this repository to seek assistance from the community. If you have experience with Solidity or smart contract development and can help me identify and resolve this issue, please feel free to contribute or provide guidance.



## How to Reproduce the Issue

To reproduce the "Stack too deep" issue, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies and tools (if not already installed).
3. Run `forge coverage` from the project's root directory.
